// Component is lazy-loaded via board.lazy.tsx for code splitting.
// Board is the most-visited landing route, but lazy loading still benefits
// initial load because the board component and its dependencies are only
// downloaded when the user actually navigates to /board (vs being bundled
// into the entry chunk). TanStack Router's autoCodeSplitting handles the
// dynamic import automatically when a .lazy.tsx file exists.
